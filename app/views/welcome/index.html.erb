    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Matt. I'm a web developer, and a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp. I came to web development after getting a taste of it in digital marketing and getting hooked on building things.</p>
    <p>This is my personal website and blog, built using Ruby on Rails. Listed below are my projects, along with links to contact me.</p>
    <p>I love building things, working in teams, and solving problems.</p>

        <h3>Hummingbird</h3>
        <p>Hummingbird was my final project at Dev Bootcamp. </p>
        <p>The app allows users to schedule text messages to be delivered at a more optimal time. </p>
        <p>Our team built the app in seven days, using a Ruby on Rails API for the back-end and an Ionic/Angular front-end.</p>

        <h3>Maps with Friends</h3>
        <p>Maps With Friends is a side project I am working on during my job search after graduating from Dev Bootcamp. </p>
        <p>A conversation with a friend from high school gave me the idea to build something that would allow me to visualize the diverse locations where my friends had scattered across the country. </p>
        <p>Technologies used include Sinatra, JavaScript, and the Google Maps API.</p>
