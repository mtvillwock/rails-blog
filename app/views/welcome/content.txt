Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a full-stack web developer with an emphasis on the full.

I love learning. I don't mean sitting in a lecture. I mean full-speed, help-
me-I'm-drowning-in-information immersive learning. Learning by doing.
Learning new technologies and design patterns and frameworks.

I came to software development to help people by leveraging technology.

Steve Jobs called computers "a bicycle for the mind." They are a ride
that I love, even if they aren't always smooth.

I care a lot. I want what I make to be spectacular. I'm hard on myself.
But it's because I care. I wouldn't be wracked with guilt or stress if
I didn't want to make the best products possible.
