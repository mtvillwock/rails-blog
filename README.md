# Rails Blog
Status: Just getting started. 

Currently has CRUD functionality for writing articles, can add/delete comments, basic admin authentication.
Some images and content added to home page.

## What is it?
I decided to remake the HTML/CSS only website I made during Phase Zero of Dev Bootcamp using Ruby on Rails.

This is a work in progress.
