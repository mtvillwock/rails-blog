# Personal Site / Blog Rails App

## What is it?
I decided to remake the HTML/CSS only website I made during Phase Zero of Dev Bootcamp using Ruby on Rails as a basis for a blogging platform. This project gave me a chance to revisit working with Rails, AJAX, and CSS. It is a work in progress, and intended to be an evergreen project.

### Status: 
v1.1 functional. Articles can be posted, edited, saved as drafts, and commented on. Admin can delete and edit articles and comments.

See it deployed at https://mtvillwock.herokuapp.com/

### Current goals:

- add fixed nav
- use scrollspying
- project gallery/pages
- stylistic and content revisions for home page
