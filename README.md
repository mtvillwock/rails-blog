# Rails Blog
Status: In progress. 

Currently has CRUD functionality for writing articles, can add/delete comments, basic HTTP authentication for admin-only actions. Second batch of CSS revisions implemented. Ongoing CSS work being done.

## What is it?
I decided to remake the HTML/CSS only website I made during Phase Zero of Dev Bootcamp using Ruby on Rails as a basis for a blogging platform.

This is a work in progress.
